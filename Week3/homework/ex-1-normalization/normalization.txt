1-What columns violate 1NF?

The answer:
The rule: All data must be atomic (every column should only contain a single value):
- food_code and member_address columns violate this rule.

The rule: Prevent duplicate records (by applying primary keys):
- There is no primary keys, the values are repeated.

The rule: Attribute domain should not change (all values in a column must be of the same kind or type).
- dinner_date column data are not the same type.

===============================================================

2- What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?

The entities are: (members-data), (dinner-data), (venue-data), (food-data).

3- Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.

Members table:
+------------+---------------+----------------+-----------+
| member_id  |  member_name  | member_address | dinner_id |
+------------+---------------+----------------+-----------+
| PRIMARY K  |  VARCHAR      |   foreign K    | foreign K |
+------------+---------------+----------------+-----------+

Member address table:
+-----------------+---------------+--------------+
| member_address  | house_number  | street_name  |
+-----------------+---------------+--------------+
| PRIMARY KEY     |  INT-VARCHAR  | VARCHAR      |
+-----------------+---------------+--------------+

Venue table:
+------------+-------------------+
| venue_code | venue_description |
+------------+-------------------+
| PRIMARY K  |       TEXT        |
+------------+-------------------+

Dinner table:
+------------+-------------+-----------+
| dinner_id  | dinner_date | venue_code|
+------------+-------------+-----------+
| PRIMARY K  |    DATE     | foreign K |
+------------+-------------+-----------+

Food table:
+------------+------------------+
| food_code  | food_description |
+------------+------------------+
| PRIMARY K  |       TEXT       |
+------------+------------------+

The relationship table between ( dinner ) and ( food ) entities:( many to many relationship ):
+-----+------------+-----------+
| id  | dinner_id  | food_code |
+- ---+------------+-----------+
| PK  | foreign K  | foreign K |
+- ---+------------+-----------+
